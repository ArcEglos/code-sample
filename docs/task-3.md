As the last task of the challenge was phrased very openly I took a closer look at the infrastructure of the repository and what I would consider missing for a production-ready setup. This would naturally be a long list. So I looked at a few criteria to pick which changes to make:

1. Impact: How much benefit would setting up this piece of infrastructure have. This means especially either benefit in terms of confidence of correctness or benefit in terms of shortening feedback cycles and increasing autonomy for the engineers.
2. Feasibility: As the setting of a challenge implies fairly limited access to resources such as github repository secrets and other paid infrastructure capabilites some projects would not be doable in a reasonable way in such a challenge
3. Uniqueness: I wanted to provide a decent spread of different topics and not focus on one area too much.

Two practical sidenotes:
1. in the real world this would never happen in a single PR, each of these changes would be a project in it's own right
2. I am of the opinion that in the real world a lot of the test of this PR description should live inside the repository in a technical documentation, where each of the decisions taken is recorded in an architecture decision record as well as a current status quo of the architecture is documented. I did this inside the PR template here because of the challenge description requesting the discussion of my changes happening in here.

## Changes

### Typescript

Probably the most impactful change for a production-grade project would for me be to switch to typescript. The amount of support it provides for both correctness as well as contextual awareness is hard to overstate. As the codebase in this example is small I was in the lucky position of being able to do the migration en block. In a real-world codebase this would most likely have to be a gradual project. This would also mean that besides the need for a technical setup that allows for such a gradual transition an immensely important parallel topic would be to support and guide all the engineers who would suddenly have to go through the learning-curve associated with working with typescript for the first time.

### Bundling

The challenge project was set up with create-react-app. This is not a setup that I would choose anymore these days for a react application. This has multiple reasons. From maintenance status of the project to the additional challenges involved in delivering great performance for the users as well as the complexity of manual maintenance after ejecting. The react team also explicitly doesn't recommend it anymore - see https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project.
In many scenarios I would currently pick remix as my framework of choice because of the elegant abstractions around data fetching and mutations that reduce complexity a lot. In the specific context of this challenge however I did go down a different route and instead opted to only switch out the underlying bundler to use vite.
This had multiple reasons:
1. The challenge setup currently doesn't require a node process, so I assumed this to be a constraint for this specific situation.
3. We are calling an external API that we control so the performance benefits of server-side-rendering would be less pronounces as the server would still have to call the external API.
4. Chakra-ui and it's dependencies contribute the overwhelming majority of bundle size outside of react itself. This means that code-splitting for the different routes of the app would not have as big of a benefit as would be possible in other situations.

Nontheless I wanted to improve the maintenance situation as well as speed up the build performance to make it a better experience for other engineers, which is why I switched to vite for bundling and vitest for testing.

### Schema validation

Together with the move to typescript I also introduced typed schema validation using `zod`. This is an especially useful measure for correctness given that we use an external API that we don't control. In this situation we can never be sure that the API doesn't change and adding this validation step gives us the confidence within our frontend codebase that the data has the shape we expect. This does Have some bundle size impact unfortunately, but the correctness guarantees make it easily worth it. Especially because it also gives engineers working with the data inside the react code a lot more context about the data, simplifying their day. Lastly, because it is integrated with the `Ã¹seSpaceX` hook it was a transparent improvement that in itself didn't need any changes within the rest of the codebase. In the future https://www.builder.io/blog/introducing-valibot could become an alternative to mitigate the bundle-size impact even further.

### CI/CD

A quick and reliably CI is one of the most powerful elements of infrastructure that one can have, in many dimensions from shipping velocity, correctness guarantees and autonomy for teams. As this setup didn't have any CI setup yet I started with a very basic setup that at least ran typechecks and tests on each PR. It also pushed a production build to netlify when the action is run on the main branch.

### Bundle splitting

Lastly, I added a demonstration for a simple bundle splitting setup to improve load-times based on routes. In this specific setup this doesn't have a big impact because of the previously mentioned dominance of chakra-ui and it's dependencies of the bundle. However, this measure would become more impactful the more the business-logic of the app would grow. Also it is intended as a demonstration of the general setup for this purpose. In most scenarios this would already be delivered by a framework like Remix or Next.js, but these frameworks might not be available as a solution in all circumstances.

## Next steps

For a real production setup there would still be a lot of aspects missing. Some of them would be:
1. Stricter repository settings to get more guarantees before merging
2. Merge queues, to allow multiple PRs being in progress of being merged at the same time
3. Visual tests
5. Bundle size limits
6. Branch- or at least staging deployments
7. Linting & formatting verification
8. Telemetry (both technical as well as product usage)
9. Versioning (making sure users use the newest builds even with existing sessions)
10. Potentially internationalization
11. Improved icon integration (based on the approach described in https://benadam.me/thoughts/react-svg-sprites/)
12. Various other aspects

Outside of these functional aspects there would also be nonfunctional ones such as:
- Time from approval to production
- CI time
- Local development setup startup time
- Local development setup reload/hot-reload time

I skipped over those to keep the scope of the changes managable for the purpose of this challenge.

Sorry for the long text and thank you for your patience reading through all this. Feel free to ask me anything in case something was not clear.
